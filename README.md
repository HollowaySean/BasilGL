# Basil Rendering Library

C++ library for simplified setup & management of OpenGL shader-based texture rendering

## Usage

Installation, build, and usage instructions will be fleshed out in upcoming release.

## Release Plan

0. ~~Basic window, support for simple ray tracer~~
1. Input system, render utilities, ray tracer, minor improvements and cleanup
   - Support for a pared down clone of "shadertoy"
   - Ease of use for example setup
   - Fill in gaps from P0
   - One or two actual examples
2. CI/CD and build system improvements
   - This phase is essentially the "v1.0" release, with user-friendly documentation and build systems
3. Output system
4. Compute shader support
5. Builders
   - This phase completes a sort of "v1.1", of the features I really want to be sure to get in
6. Emscripten support
7. Metaprogramming system
   - These later phases are conditional on if I can figure out how to implement them, and are sort of stretch goals
